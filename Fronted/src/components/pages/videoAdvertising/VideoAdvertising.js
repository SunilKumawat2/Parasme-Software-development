                <h2>You can use a variety of Video Ads</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>1-&nbsp; &nbsp;TrueView Video Ads&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The upside of using TrueView ads is that you’ll only get
                  charged when a user watches or interacts with your video
                  content, that way you don’t lose money over inaccurate
                  interactions and random impressions.
                </p>
                <p>You can find two types of TrueView ads:</p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;●&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>In-stream ads</strong>:
                  These ads can be played before, during, and or after YouTube
                  videos, on partner websites, and apps. The viewer has the
                  option of skipping these ads after watching the first 5
                  seconds. This type of ad spreads awareness for your brand,
                  products, and services while being displayed via video.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp;●&nbsp; &nbsp;
                  <strong>Video discovery ads</strong>: This type of ad is
                  usually displayed where users discover new content; on
                  YouTube, you can find it next to the “related videos”
                  suggestions or on the YouTube homepage. If users are
                  interested in what you’re offering, they’ll be compelled to
                  click on the thumbnail, watch your video ad, and become
                  customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TrueView Videos ads are most suited to be used across the
                  Display Network and on YouTube, particularly if you want to
                  promote and boost your content before some other targeted
                  content.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>2-&nbsp; &nbsp;Bumper Ads&nbsp;</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Quick and straight-to-the-point ads that will deliver your
                  brand’s message and expand its awareness, using fast video
                  formats made to reach the maximum number of people possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>3-&nbsp; &nbsp;Outstream Ads</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This type of video ad can only be found on mobile phones,
                  they’re displayed on apps and sites that are associated with
                  your brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outstream Ads are generally used to expand the scope of your
                  mobile video ads and help you get more clients for your
                  company.

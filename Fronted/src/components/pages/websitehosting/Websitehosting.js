                <h2>E-commerce website hosting</h2>
                <p>
                  The configurations and needs required to manage an E-commerce
                  website are different from those of a regular website.
                  Therefore, it’s wiser to evaluate your e-commerce web hosting
                  before clients start having difficulties following through
                  with an order because of your website’s inability to load.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The biggest problem e-commerce websites usually face is having
                  a lot of downtimes, mainly caused by their specific needs of
                  producing a higher traffic flow than regular sites. Website
                  downtime occurs because e-commerce sites send a great number
                  of requests to servers that can not handle them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your online store needs to be fast to boost your online
                  presence and maintain a high-quality user experience. People
                  use the internet to make instant purchases; users will drop it
                  for rival businesses if your website takes too long to load.

                  <strong>
                    According to Statista.com, “Since January 2021, 59.5% of the
                    world population (4.66 billion people) have been active
                    internet users, and 92.6% (4.32 billion) have accessed the
                    internet through mobile devices”.{" "}
                  </strong>
                  With the constant growth of mobile usage on the internet,
                  E-commerce websites should be hosted on servers capable of
                  managing and handling mobile orders to keep users happy.

                  To provide the best online experience for your customers, your
                  online domain must be secure and safe. Since E-commerce
                  websites have more users, solid hosting servers with more
                  extensive security measurements are needed to keep both users
                  and sites safe from any online danger. Every e-commerce store
                  has to cater to its visitor’s specific needs by having a
                  user-friendly website that satisfies their demands.

                <p>
                  Nowadays, there has been a remarkable upsurge in hackers that
                  steal private and secret data. As an online shop owner, you
                  must keep your e-commerce business safe. Setting up an SSL
                  certificate is highly advised if your site includes data
                  transfer elements.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you install SSL certificates on your web server, the
                  small data will kick start the security lock and the HTTPS
                  protocol, establishing a safe connection between your web
                  server and your user’s browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  SSL integration is usually applied to procure the user’s
                  private information, safe credit card transactions, logins,
                  and data transfer. At Parasme, we provide various SSL

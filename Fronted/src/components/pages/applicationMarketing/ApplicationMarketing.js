                <p>
                  As mobile ownership is becoming a more important aspect of
                  daily life, desktop usage is dropping. People can't go a day
                  without looking at their mobile devices. As a result,
                  companies should develop a robust mobile app marketing
                  strategy to increase user engagement.

                  Some websites may be difficult to view if you work for a
                  company that uses blockers to restrict internet access; mobile
                  apps are not an issue because they provide unlimited access.

                  Every customer has different expectations from your app;
                  therefore, we devise a different advertising strategy based on
                  your target audience’s preferences.

                  A music app, for example, may include a variety of music
                  genres, podcasts, and performers. Each user looks for their
                  favorite musician or listens to music from specific genres
                  such as pop, country, or rock. We advertise to each listener
                  using targeted keywords and intelligent analytics according to
                  their preferences.&nbsp;

                  When your company app has a problem or experiences a bug and
                  doesn't have a customer service feature, visiting your site or
                  sending an email to report the issue will take your customer's
                  time and energy. If your clients have difficulty reaching you,
                  they will seek your competitors.

                <p>
                  A crucial part of app marketing is to study the market and
                  competitive landscape to see what designs, techniques, and
                  trends your rivals are using to promote their apps.

                  Designing a landing page with captivating visuals is crucial
                  for a successful mobile marketing strategy. Landing pages must
                  be aesthetically pleasing and contain images that familiarize
                  people with the app and encourage them to download it.
                  Finally, it’s very important to add users’ feedback and
                  reviews about their experience with your app.

                  It’s always good to keep your website blog up-to-date and
                  directly connected to your social media platforms. It’s a
                  cost-effective technique that lets you employ SEO to appeal to
                  a new target audience by observing your analytics to determine
                  the content that profits your marketing strategy the most.

                  App Store Optimization (ASO) helps you display your app in an
                  eye-catching way to increase its visibility in Google Play
                  Store and the App Store. At Parasme, we determine and employ
                  specific keywords and display screenshots and a video of an
                  in-app use so that your app has a higher ranking in the App

                  Posting on your social media accounts and working on your
                  content should be a regular thing, not just to raise awareness
                  about your brand, but to engage with your audience, form a
                  bond with them, and build a solid community. By focusing on
                  social media marketing, you can interact with your users and
                  check their feedback to fix any issue. It’s highly recommended
                  that your app includes social media access for people to
                  directly share content from your app on their social media
                  profiles.

                  Influencer marketing has become a common app marketing tactic
                  because people follow and trust influencers. You can
                  collaborate with influencers by offering them free products
                  from your app to share on their social media accounts; this is
                  a cost-effective method that doesn’t give you much creative
                  control. If you want to be more involved in your app
                  promotion, you can start a paid partnership with the
                  influencer of your choice.

                  Paid user acquisition is a marketing method that introduces
                  your app to new people via paid ads. It’s crucial to define
                  your target audience and the in-app actions you want them to
                  do before setting your paid user acquisition strategy. That
                  way, you’ll make sure that you’re efficiently spending your
                  money. Keep a close eye on the new trends and data in your
                  clients’ behavior; Parasme will give you a full report on what
                  actions your users are taking with the paid ads and which
                  social media channels are getting the best performance to
                  increase your profit.

                <p>
                    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide the campaign and
                    in-app activity related to your business goals. When you
                    measure your performance with KPIs like the number of Active
                    Users, Cost per Acquisition (CPA), Cost per Install (CPI),
                    Click-Through Rate (CTR), and more, you get insights into how
                    your app is performing and detect the weaknesses that need

                  Retention rate is determined by the number of people using
                  your app for a specific period of time. Our team at Parasme
                  uses retention to increase your app lifetime value (LTV) and
                  return on ad spend (ROAS), as well as find out the reason
                  people lose interest, prevent it, and improve your app. Our
                  goal is to retain users for as long as possible for your app
                  to get more significant interactions and profits.

                  Email marketing is a strategy that helps you grow your
                  retention rates and get more income. Email marketing targets
                  people who have shown interest in your app by creating a
                  mailing list to keep them updated about your latest offers and
                  trends. A key component of email marketing is to craft
                  customized emails with a clever call to action (CTA) that will
                  compel people to visit your website or download your app.

                  By designing visually engaging infographics and sharing them
                  on your blog, with writers, or on your social media account,
                  you will be promoting your app in a creative way that helps

                  If your app is not free, you can provide people with a free
                  trial run to gather more data about user behavior. Then, when
                  you forge genuine connections with your users, there’s a
                  higher chance for them to subscribe and pay for your app.

              <div className="container-left">
                <p>
                  When you set up your website, you’ll need to increase the
                  number of visitors as much as possible, which is where SEO, or
                  Search Engine Optimization, comes in handy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Search Engine Optimization (also known as Search Marketing) is
                  the process of editing and adapting the content of your
                  website to increase its chances of ranking higher on search
                  engines. As a result, your website will receive more traffic,
                  thus receiving more leads and clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, building a website is the first step in setting up a
                  company. Therefore, the number of websites is increasing, and
                  they are all competing to grab the attention of potential
                  clients browsing the internet for different products and
                  services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Planning is the first and most crucial step in every strategy.
                  Parasme studies the field thoroughly and conducts SEO Audits
                  meticulously before drawing any strategy for your website. We
                  take into account the 200 and more elements that Google
                  considers when determining a web page’s placement on the
                  search engine.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the campaign, we monitor your search rankings to
                  find more relevant keywords. In addition to other variables,
                  such as your website’s user traffic, the number of other
                  websites referring to it and if your site is facing any
                  problems. We also send our clients regular reports, outlining
                  the information we discover to demonstrate how your campaign’s
                  progress.

                  An online business offers a significant number of options to
                  attract new customers through search engines. Mainly due to
                  the large number of pages available on site, the diverse
                  content and the huge amount of search keywords that could help

                  When it comes to SEO, Google considers a huge set of
